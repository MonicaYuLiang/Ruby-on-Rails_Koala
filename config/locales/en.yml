# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      lfseg03: "Master Baker Jackie Jegat, the owner and founder of Paris Bakery, was born in Dou√©-la-Fontaine, France where he began his baking career at the age of 16. He started as a baker's apprentice for a shop in Saumur, France. After two years of apprenticeship, he moved to Paris. In 1978, at age 23, Jackie opened his first bakery in Chatou, a suburb of Paris, where he soon brought his brother Eric to serve as his apprentice."
      lfseg04: "BEST BAKERY EVER"
      lfseg05: "C'est magnifique!"
      lfseg06: "As the children have grown, they have all been very much a part of the bakery - some help out when they can and some hope to carry on the tradition for years to come. Currently Vivianne is running the wholesale department and helps her dad out with the Monterey store. Jackie's brother, Eric, has opened up his own bakery in Cottage Grove, Oregon. Jackie, now 56, is still baking 7 days a week. He says he's never felt better and is happy to see his bakery full of satisfied customers."
