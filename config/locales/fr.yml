He started as a baker's apprentice for a shop in Saumur, France. After two years of apprenticeship, he moved to Paris. In 1978, at age 23, Jackie opened his first bakery in Chatou, a suburb of Paris, where he soon brought his brother Eric to serve as his apprentice."

      lfseg06: "~~As the children have grown, they have all been very much a part of the bakery - some help out when they can and some hope to carry on the tradition for years to come. Currently Vivianne is running the wholesale department and helps her dad out with the Monterey store. Jackie's brother, Eric, has opened up his own bakery in Cottage Grove, Oregon. Jackie, now 56, is still baking 7 days a week. He says he's never felt better and is happy to see his bakery full of satisfied customers."
